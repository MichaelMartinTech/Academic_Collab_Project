## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Requirements**

   ***In AcademicCollabProject***, install all necessary Python packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Prepare the Data**

   - Create a directory named `data` in the project root:

     ```bash
     mkdir data
     ```

   - Download and save the raw Open Academic Graph (OAG) files from this Google Drive folder: **(Make sure to extract zip, all raw data should be in same directory)**

     [OAG Data on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yDdVaartOCOSsQlUZs8cJcAUhmvRiBSz)

   - Place all downloaded files into the newly created `data/` directory.

**In your visual studio solution, it should look something like this:**
